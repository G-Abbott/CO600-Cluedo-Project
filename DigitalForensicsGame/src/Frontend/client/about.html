      <h1 class="display-3">About Digital Forensics Detective</h1>
      <p>Digital Forensics detective is a spin off version of the original cluedo game. It uses characters and places from Kent University and adds a digital forensics twist. This includes various attacks such as DDoS and Phishing in place of the weapons that cluedo originally had.</p>
   	  <h3 class="display-5">Aim of the Game</h3>
   	  <p>The aim of the game is to correctly guess who committed the Digital Forensics crime based on the clues collected throughout the game.</p>
   	  <h3 class="display-5">Rules</h3>
   	  <p> The game can be played by 2-4 players, with the following roles: Lecturer, Student, Administrator, Technician.</p>
   	  <p> Once the game has begun each player will be dealt an equal number of cards, selected randomally from all of the suspects, methods and rooms.
   	  Players will take turns to roll the dice to determine how many spaces they can move across the board. A player can only move once per turn, any move points they decide not to use will be forfeited. After a player has moved, they need to
   	  select the 'End Turn' button to pass onto the next player.</p>
   	  <p> If a player is by a room door, they can enter by selecting the "Enter Room" button. When in a room, a player can make an accusation or guess involving the room they are in. A player can perform these actions by selecting the "Make Guess" or "Make Accusation" button. When
   	  making a guess, select one suspect and one method to go along with the room the player is in. After a player has made a guess, if they have any relevant cards, another player will select a card to show you and prove your guess is wrong. You can only make one guess per turn but you
   	  can still move on the same turn (this also applies to moving out from a room, but your roll will be counted from the door of the room). If another player makes a guess with one of your cards, you will be asked to show one of them. Do this by selecting your card from the guess they made.</p>
   	  <p> Making an accusation works in a similar way but if you are right you win the game, and if you are wrong you are out of the game. If you are unsure about your accusation or guess you can cancel it. If you get your accusation wrong, you can no longer take turns but you can pick cards to show
   	  other players.</p>
   	  <h3 class="display-5">How to start</h3>
   	  <p>To begin the game, select the 'Join Game' button in the main menu. Once in the lobby screen, the game will start when all
   	  players click the 'Ready' button. </p>
