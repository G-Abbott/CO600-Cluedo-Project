C0600 Group Project - Digital Forensics Detective

By George Abbott (gaa21), Lewis Sainsbury (lds29), Tom Griffin (tg252) and Shay Ritchie (sr574).

Our game is a recreation of the original game of Cluedo base off of Kent University and with a digital forensics twist.

For a base we used an existing version of a Javascript cluedo game from this git repository:
https://github.com/tjkuson/cluedo-js


This gave us a basic layout and game board to work from however it lacked the features that we wanted and it contained various bugs and issues.
