C0600 Group Project - Digital Forensics Detective

By George Abbott (gaa21), Lewis Sainsbury (lds29), Tom Griffin (tg252) and Shay Ritchie (sr574).

Our game is a recreation of the original game of Cluedo base off of Kent University and with a digital forensics twist.

For a base we used an existing version of a Javascript cluedo game from this git repository by Tom Kuson, made in Feburary 2018

/********************************************************************
- Author : Tom Kuson
- Date : 12/02/2018
- Title: cluedo-js
- Code version : 1.0.0
- Web address : https://github.com/tjkuson/cluedo-js

**********************************************************************/

This gave us a basic layout and game board to work from however it lacked the features that we wanted and it contained various bugs and issues.

*************Running the Server*************

Our current implementation runs on Kent University's raptor server however this version can be run locally

To start the server open the frontend folder in command line and type 'node server'

To play navigate within a browser to the address: localhost:4444

Any issues or to restart the game, please restart the server.
